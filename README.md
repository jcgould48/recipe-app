### All your favorite recipes app

Hello, and welcome to my app! It is hosted through Surge so you can access it any time.

[Follow the All your favorite recipes link!](recipe-tracker.surge.sh)

#### About the App
This is a application that is designed to help you keep track of all your favorite recipes that you have prepared in the past.

Never again will you be in a situation where you are trying to remember the specifics of a recipe you made months ago.

**Technical Aspects**  
This app was made with html, Javascript, and CSS.  Many of the CSS features are enhanced through Bootstrap.

The app is also reflexive to size changes allowing the user to use it on their computer, tablet or cellphone.

The app is hosted on Surge but the code can also be accessed through Github.

**Important for the graders** 
Within the Github Repository is a folder named 'wire-frames' which contains images of the planned wire-frames at the start of this project.

#### So, how do I use this app?

All your favorite recipes app is very easy to use.  It asks for three inputs and then the user just has to press the add the recipe button.

* Step one : Input recipe information

The first input will be what ever you would like to call this recipe.

The second input is the exact url of the site where you found the recipe

The last input is a url of a picture that best represents the recipe so you can easily recognize it in the future.  You can copy a link to one of the images from the recipe's website or find another image.

  * Step two : Click 'Add Recipe' Button (Blue)
  * Step three: Check your recipe was added at the bottom

**Remove Recipe**
If you made a mistake while adding a recipe or you change you mind on an older recipe you can easily remove it. 

Locate the checkbox on the right side of each photo. Click it to check it and then press the 'Remove Selected Recipe' Button (yellow).  You can select as many as you would like.

**Remove All Recipes**
If you decide that you would just like to completely start over, there is a 'Remove All Recipes' Button (red).  Be careful though! Once you press this button ALL the recipes will be deleted.

#### Extra Features

To start you off we already added some recipes that you may like.  Feel free to delete some of all of them through the process listed above. 

Whenever you want to revisit an old recipe, you can easily click the picture and it will take you directly to the website.

This website can also be used on any device you prefer.


I hope you enjoy!  Please let me know if you find any bugs! 

And tell my professors to give this a good grade.
