### About the App
This is a application that is designed to help you keep track of all your favorite recipes that you have prepared in the past.

Never again will you be in a situation where you are trying to remember the specifics of a recipe you made months ago.

**Technical Aspects**  
This app was made with html, Javascript, and CSS.  Many of the CSS features are enhanced through Bootstrap.

The app is also reflexive to size changes allowing the user to use it on their computer, tablet or cellphone.

** Important for the graders**
